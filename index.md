## About Me

I recently graduated with my Ph.D. from Duke University where I worked with Ron Parr on transfer learning in value-based reinforcement learning methods.


## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning. In particular, I am interested in value function approximation, transfer learning, representation learning, and hierarchical reinforcement learning.
